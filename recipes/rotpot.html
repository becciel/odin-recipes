    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These potatoes make a great side dish, especially for chicken.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 big potatoes</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>2.5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cube the potatoes in 4×4 cm – 1.5×1.5 inch pieces.  Put them in a bowl full of cold water and set aside for at least 30 minutes.  This will make the potatoes crispier when baked in the oven.</li>
        <li>Drain them roughly and put the wet potatoes in a baking dish with the paprika, garlic and onion powders, salt and 2.5 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil.  Mix well making sure that the potatoes are well coated with the mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated fan forced oven at 180°C – 350°F until the potatoes are cooked through and golden.</li>
    </ol>
