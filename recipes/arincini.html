    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Arincini balls are fried balls of saffron rice stuffed with either a meat sauce or a cheese sauce.  The cheese version is called “al burro” that literally means “with butter”, but they are actually filled with béchamel sauce, cheese, ham and peas, while the meat arancine have a thick filling of bolognese sauce with peas, mozzarella and mortadella. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium sized onion</li>
        <li>1 big carrot</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk</li>
        <li>300 gms – 10.5 oz. of beef mince (lean but preferably not the heart smart one as that is too lean for this dish)</li>
        <li>1 piece of Italian sausage (better with fennel) – approx 200 gms / 7 oz. – optional (if you don’t like this, just add a little extra mince)</li>
        <li>½ glass of red wine</li>
        <li>600 ml – 21 oz. tomato purée or 400 ml – 14 oz. tinned diced tomatoes PLUS 200 ml – 7 oz. tomato purée</li>
        <li>1 small tin tomato concentrate</li>
        <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>5 peppercorns or a pinch of freshly grated pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup of frozen baby peas</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese, diced</li>
        <li>Mortadella, sliced and diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finley dice the onion, carrot and celery and put them in a pot with the extra virgin olive oil. Let them fry on slow fire till soft (but not brown).</li>
        <li>Add the mince and the sausage (without skin) and stir well. Make sure to break the mince and sausage so that there are no lumps and it all browns well.</li>
        <li>Raise the fire a little bit and add the red wine.</li>
        <li>When the alcohol has evaporated add salt, the peppercorns and the tomato puree.</li>
        <li>Add 4 glasses of water and the salt and stir.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and cook on low fire for at least 1 hour (the more the better).</li>
        <li>When almost cooked add the frozen peas and let them cook.  Add water if needed (or reduce the excess water) until the right consistency is achieved.  It has to be quite thick to make stuffing easier.</li>
    </ol>
